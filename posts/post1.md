Ciao!
<br>
<br>
I launched this blog because I needed a space to set my thoughts and reflections in black and white (literally). By doing so, I hope these insights will be engaging and useful to you.
<br>
<br>
In this open diary I'll write about whatever captures my curiosity. Major topics will include data science, world news, and considerations about life (in Denmark) — though I won't limit myself to just these themes.
<br>
<br>
This blog builds on 3 core principles:
<ol class = "list-decimal pl-10">
  <li>curiosity;</li>
  <li>transparency;</li>
  <li>helpfulness.</li>
</ol>
<br>
This might not be the most interactive format, but I'm still curious to hear your opinions and feedback. Feel free to reach out at <a class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;" href = "mailto:pietrorebecchi003@gmail.com">pietrorebecchi003@gmail.com</a> anytime!
<br>
<br>
I’ll constantly try to improve the blog. There’s more to come!
