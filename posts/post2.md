<h3>Introduction</h3>
In August 2023, I moved to Denmark — more precisely to Copenhagen — to begin my <a href = "https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/BSc-Programmes/Data-Science" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;">BSc in Data Science</a> at IT University of Copenhagen (ITU).
<br>
Since then, many people have asked me what it's like to live and study in the Danish capital. So, I decided to write this post to share an overview based on my experience. I include comparisons with Italy to give readers a clearer understanding — especially because most of the people who asked me about it are Italian.
<h3>Why Copenhagen?</h3>
After a year at the University of Trento in Italy, I decided to change my studies and to do so by moving abroad.
<br>
At the time, the only countries I considered were the Netherlands and Denmark. I focused on these two because they both offered the BSc I was looking for (Data Science) in English as well as an international environment. Moreover, they were both countries where I could see myself living.
<br>
I ultimately chose to study at IT University of Copenhagen because the course presentation and my interactions with the university gave me a very good impression.
<br>
I also had the opportunity to speak with a few Italians, to whom I’ll always be grateful, who were already studying or working in Copenhagen. They gave me advice and insights about the city and student life, which helped me make a more informed decision and ultimately brought me up north.
<h3>Teaching, Facilities & Community</h3>
Based on my experience, the teaching style is quite similar to the Italian system: theoretical lectures followed by practical classes. However, in Denmark there’s often a stronger focus on hands-on learning. Many courses are designed around group or individual projects, or include mandatory activities (usually small projects or assignments) that are required in order to access the final exam.
<br>
What differs the most is the student-professor relationship, which in Denmark is more relaxed and less formal. This is likely encouraged by smaller class sizes and younger instructors.
<br>
I've had the opportunity to visit different universities in Copenhagen, and I can confidently say that the facilities are generally good — with plenty of well-designed spaces that encourage studying. However, the university isn't just a place for academics, but also a social hub: most institutions organise regular events such as the popular “Friday Bar” and host a variety of student organisations with different focuses.
<h3>Accommodation</h3>
When it comes to student housing, there are two main options in Copenhagen: shared apartments and dorms. 
<br>
It’s possible to find a room in a shared apartment through Facebook — there are many groups where people post room listings or look for new roommates. These are often students or young professionals.
<br>
The second option is dormitories, which can be either public or private. From my own experience, private dorms are overpriced and usually targeted at exchange or Erasmus students — which can make it harder to build long-term friendships, as many leave after just one semester. Public dorms often have waiting lists ranging from 3 to 12 months, but they are much more affordable. You might get a room in a shared apartment, a studio, or even something larger at a reasonable price. There are several websites where you can register and fill out applications — for example <a href = "https://www.s.dk/" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;">s.dk</a> and <a href = "https://www.kollegierneskontor.dk/" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;">kollegierneskontor.dk</a>.
<br>
In general, housing prices range approximately between 3,000 and 7,000 DKK per month (~400-1,000 euros). In some cases, you might be eligible for a housing benefit (<a href = "https://www.borger.dk/bolig-og-flytning/Boligstoette-oversigt?cookiebanner=true" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;"><i>Boligstøtte</i></a>), which is calculated based on factors like apartment size, rent, income, and other conditions.
<h3>Cost of Living</h3>
When someone asks me about the cost of living in Copenhagen, I always give the same answer: I spend about the same as I did when I was studying in Trento — but it really depends on your lifestyle.
<br>
For example, I spend roughly 1,200 to 1,400 DKK (~160-190 euros) per month on groceries. I'm vegetarian and rarely eat fish, so my diet doesn't include meat or seafood, which are quite expensive here.
<br>
At least in my experience, going out for food in the way it's common in Italy isn't very typical in Denmark. It’s more about hanging out at someone’s place or going out for a drink rather than having a full meal out. On average, I’d say I spend around 300 DKK (~40 euros) per month on that.
<br>
You can bike all year round without having the need to use public transport. In fact, the bike infrastructure is amazing – bike lanes are wide, well separated from car traffic, and make it very easy to move around the city and even outside of it. Biking is possible in every season; however, it's good to know that winters in Copenhagen are a bit colder and windier than in Northern Italy, so dressing appropriately for the weather is crucial.
<br>
Since moving here, I've found myself appreciating things that are simple, free, and available to everyone - no need to spend money to enjoy them. There are things I now enjoy and value more than I did before — like walking with someone in the city center, taking an evening stroll through a park, going for a (cold) dip in the canals or sea, or biking along the coast.
<h3>Some Practicalities</h3>
The main universities in Copenhagen that offer BSc, MSc, or both in English are the <a href = "https://en.itu.dk" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;">IT University of Copenhagen</a> (ITU), the <a href = "https://www.ku.dk/en" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;">University of Copenhagen</a> (UCPH), the <a href = "https://www.cbs.dk/en" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;">Copenhagen Business School</a> (CBS), and the <a href = "https://www.dtu.dk/english/" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;">Technical University of Denmark</a> (DTU).
<br>
Regarding accommodation, in some cases, you might be eligible for a housing benefit (<a href = "https://www.borger.dk/bolig-og-flytning/Boligstoette-oversigt?cookiebanner=true" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;"><i>Boligstøtte</i></a>), which is calculated based on factors like apartment size, rent, income, and other conditions.
<br>
If you work in Denmark as a student for 10-12 hours per week, you should be eligible to receive a monthly grant (<a href = "https://www.su.dk/english" class = "inline-block no-underline hover:underline" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" style = "color: #1e39d0;"><i>Statens Uddannelsesstøtte</i></a>, or SU) from the state, which adds to your regular job salary.
